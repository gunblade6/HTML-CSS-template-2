## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the second HTML - CSS project I make and it was a life changing for me to make the second website by my own after learning HTML - CSS.
It basicly taught me more of the basics of workflow and making websites.

### Continued development

Now looking forward to making new templates and websites to increase my HTML - CSS code before going into JS.
